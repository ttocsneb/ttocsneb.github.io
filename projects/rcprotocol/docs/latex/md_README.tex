\subsection*{About}

RC Protocol allows a remote to pair with more than 1 rc device as well as the abillity to connect add-\/ons\+: a device that gives the remote more functionality, such as a gimball controller, or a telemetry device.

The Protocol is a library. It does not connect directly to any IO devices other than the tranceiver (R\+F24\+L01(+)), and add-\/ons through iÂ²c.

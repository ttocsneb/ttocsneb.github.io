In English class, we have been reading The Lord of the Flies.  We are assigned to write about how our actions relate to characters in the book.  I will be writing about my similarities with a few characters in the book, I will most likely spit up each character into a separate post.  The first character I will write about is Ralph.

Ralph is probably my favorite character in the book.  He is one of the saner characters in the story and is a good leader.  At the beginning of the book, the gathered everybody with the magic conch shell and stayed focused on the task at hand, getting rescued.

I think that of all the characters in the book, I am kind of like Ralph.  I think of myself as a good leader, though I don't like to be the leader.  I am also determined, despite not trying to get rescued.  I further like to think of myself as pretty sane.  I even can get notably focused, though generally not in what would be best.

Though don't think of myself as a clone of Ralph, we are also very different from each other.  Ralph is an extrovert, I am not.  Ralph is a leader, I am not.. well I can be a leader, but I try not to be.

Yesterday, I talked about my relation to Ralph, today I will talk about Piggy, or whatever his real name is.  Piggy is another one of my favorite characters. I can relate to him throughout the book, though noteably not the part where died.  He is smart, and has some pretty neat glasses.

Piggy was the brains of Ralph's group.  He was able to create fire with his glasses.  

I am most like piggy.  He is smart, People tell me I'm smart.  He is inventive, I like to create inventions.

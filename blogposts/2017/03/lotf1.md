In English class, we have been reading The Lord of the Flies.  We are assigned to write about how our actions relate to characters in the book.  I will be writing about my similarities with a few characters in the book, I will most likely spit up each character into a separate post.  The first character I will write about is Ralph.

Ralph is probably my favorite character in the book.  He is one of the saner characters in the story and is a good leader.  At the beginning of the book, the gathered everybody with the magic conch shell and stayed focused on the task at hand, getting rescued.  

I think that of all the characters in the book, I am most like Ralph.  I think of myself as a good leader, though I don't like to be the leader.  I am also determined, despite not trying to get rescued.  I further like to think of myself as pretty sane.  I even can get notably focused, though generally not in what would be best.

Though don't think of myself as a clone of Ralph, we are also very different from each other.  Ralph is an extrovert, I am not.  <Something else..>
